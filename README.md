# Finite-Element-Analysis-of-Heat-Recuperators
Using MSC Marc-Mentat software, a numerical analysis was carried out to compare the performance of wavy and straight channel heat recuperators. The study focused on aspects like design, optimization, and axial heat conduction to evaluate and contrast the two types of heat recuperators.

# Note:
The folder named "MSC Marc-Mentat_Models" includes all the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models for the heat recuperators. The PDF file titled "Project_report" provides a detailed discussion on the numerical analysis conducted for comparing the heat recuperators with wavy and straight geometries.
